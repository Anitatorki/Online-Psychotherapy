    Self-knowledge is apparently the easiest and in fact, the most difficult task that we have before ourselves and before the world. A task that we cannot achieve alone and in a vacuum. In proportion to our emotional and human experiences, all of us have psychic reserves full of deep emotional and often unprocessed memories and experiences. As long as these experiences remain unprocessed and unconscious, they can shape our destiny and future in an unpleasant and conflicting way.Analytical psychotherapy helps us to achieve this essential task in a safe environment with the help of a companion and sympathetic psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>By knowing ourselves properly, resolving our intense and often repressed emotions, and establishing a healthy relationship within a therapeutic framework, we can find a new path toward the correct and complete development of our talents and love ourselves as we are.</p>

    <h4>What is psychotherapy?</h4>
    <p>
      Psychotherapy refers to a range of psychological interventions that aim to help people to know themselves and solve emotional, communication and interpersonal problems.Psychotherapy helps people to recognize their emotions, and understand how their emotions are affected by different issues.Through psychotherapy, people learn how to deal with the difficult and critical issues of life with the least damage and in the most adaptive way possible, and at the same time, to be aware and master their emotions. Psychotherapy courses are usually more than 6 months and depending on the treatment approach, they may last up to several years. Psychotherapy, regardless of the approach and type of problem, has a growing satisfaction for all people, and its duration means more growth for the individual.</p>
    <p>
      The length of the treatment period does not mean that the person is sick or that the problem is severe. Rather, it means the depth and comprehensiveness of the treatment, and the greater ability of the person to invest in knowing his inner dimensions. Because the inside of humans is layered and the more time we spend getting to know it, the deeper layers we discover. The more time we dedicate to getting to know ourselves, the more talents we will recognize and the more growth we will achieve. The goal of psychotherapy is to reach the maturity of the personality and the ability to solve problems and internal and external conflicts in an adaptive way and to know oneself correctly. Self-knowledge is the greatest mission of every human being. Our biggest responsibility in life is knowing ourselves correctly and honestly... the person who is closest to us and we have the most responsibility towards him.
      Psychotherapy has different approaches. These treatments include behaviour therapy, cognitive therapy, schema therapy, reality therapy, existential therapy, interpersonal therapy, analytical psychotherapy, and psychoanalysis, in order of depth and focus on limited or extensive symptoms.

    <h4>What is analytical psychotherapy?</h4>
    <p>Analytical psychotherapy or psychoanalytic psychotherapy is one of the types of deep psychotherapy that focuses on revealing the unconscious content and interpersonal relationships of the patient, especially the current and ongoing relationships between the patient and the therapist. This deep, genuine and healing relationship between the patient and the therapist has caused the fundamental issues of the patient to be raised, and it is tried to analyze these issues and correct them in the context of a new and healthy relationship.</p>
    <p>Analytical therapy is actually a more updated version of psychoanalysis, less intensive, and with fewer sessions per week (usually once or twice a week).</p>

    <p>When you think about psychology, the first name that comes to your mind is Sigmund Freud. He proposed that every mental illness is not due to psychological factors. His work is based on clinical and abnormal psychology.</p>

    <p>Melanie Klein (née Reizes; 30 March 1882 – 22 September 1960) was an Austrian-British author and psychoanalyst known for her work in child analysis. She was the primary figure in the development of object relations theory. Klein suggested that pre-verbal existential anxiety in infancy catalyzed the formation of the unconscious, resulting in the unconscious splitting of the world into good and bad idealizations. In her theory, how the child resolves that split depends on the constitution of the child and the character of nurturing the child experiences; the quality of resolution can inform the presence, absence, and/or type of distresses a person experiences later in life.</p>
